Hi all,

This was a website I created early in my journey, the code is messy, but it works somehow. 
The aesthetics of the page are rough, but I will keep the site as it is as a testimatent to the coding journey I have been on and to compare my future work to.

I have since begun studying at Flatiron and my skills have improved significantly, therefore, any update to the site will be a complete overhaul.

thanks!
